An extension [manifest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/) gives the browser information about the extension, such as the most important files and the capabilities the extension might use. The extension platform features change when there's a new [manifest version](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/manifest_version/).

Manifest V3 represents one of the most significant shifts in the extensions platform since it launched a decade ago. Manifest V3 extensions enjoy enhancements in security, privacy, and performance; they can also use more contemporary open web technologies such as service workers and promises.

As of January 17, 2022 the Chrome Web Store has stopped accepting new Manifest V2 extensions. We strongly recommend migrating your extensions to Manifest V3 as soon as possible; this will become mandatory after [Manifest V2 is phased out](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/) in 2024.
