Chrome provides extensions with many special-purpose APIs such as `chrome.alarms` and `chrome.action`. Many APIs consist of a namespace and its related manifest fields. These fields are frequently permissions, but not always. For example, `chrome.alarms` requires only the `alarms` permission, while `chrome.action` requires an action object in the `manifest.json` file.

[#](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/#api-conventions) API conventions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless stated otherwise, methods in the `chrome.*` APIs are **asynchronous**: they return immediately, without waiting for the operation to finish. If you need to know the result of calling such methods, use the returned promise or pass a callback function into the method. For more information, see [Asynchronous methods](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/architecture-overview/#async-sync).

Stable APIs
-----------

Release information is not available for APIs before Chrome 42, which was released in early 2015.

Name

Description

[accessibilityFeatures](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/accessibilityFeatures)

Use the `chrome.accessibilityFeatures` API to manage Chrome's accessibility features. This API relies on the [ChromeSetting prototype of the type API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/types/#ChromeSetting) for getting and setting individual accessibility features. In order to get feature states the extension must request `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission. For modifying feature state, the extension needs `accessibilityFeatures.modify` permission. Note that `accessibilityFeatures.modify` does not imply `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission.
