<small>Published on Monday, November 9, 2020 • Updated on Tuesday, September 20, 2022</small>

These pages contain guides and reference information for developers who want to create extensions for the Chrome browser.

If you're not sure where to begin, have a look at the following starting pages:

- [Extensions 101](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/extensions-101/) covers some basic concepts of extension development.
- [Development Basics](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/) introduces the extension development workflow.

Beyond that, you might find useful entry points in these pages:

- Choose one of the step-by-step [getting started tutorials](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#tutorials).
- Learn the scope of things in the [Extension development overview](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/devguide/).
- Pick something from the [samples page](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples), install it, and start hacking on it.

::: danger Warning

As Manifest V3 approaches full feature parity with V2, we will be phasing out Manifest V2 in 2023. See [Manifest V2 support timeline](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/) for details.

In addition to the documentation here, many developers find helpful community content at:

- The [Chromium extensions](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions) Google Group.
- The Stack Overflow [google-chrome extension](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-chrome-extension) tag.

Thank you for being a member of the extension developer community. We're glad you are here!
