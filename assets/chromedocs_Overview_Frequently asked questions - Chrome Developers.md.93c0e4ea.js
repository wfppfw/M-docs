You can start by turning on Developer mode.</p><p>Click the Chrome menu icon and select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu. Ensure that the &quot;Developer mode&quot; checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked. Now you can reload extensions, load an unpacked directory of files as if it were a packaged extension, and more.

HTML is used as a content markup language, CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript for scripting. Because Chrome supports HTML5 and CSS3, developers can use the latest open web technologies such as canvas and CSS animations in their extensions. Extensions also have access to several <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript APIs</a> that help perform functions like JSON encoding and interacting with the browser.</p><h3 id="are-extensions-fetched-from-the-web-every-time-the-browser-is-loaded" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/faq/#faq-gen-03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#</a> Are extensions fetched from the web every time the browser is loaded? <a class="header-anchor" href="#are-extensions-fetched-from-the-web-every-time-the-browser-is-loaded" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Extensions are downloaded by the Chrome browser upon install, and are subsequently run off of the local disk in order to speed up performance. However, if a new version of the extension is pushed online, it will be automatically downloaded in the background to any users who have the extension installed. Extensions may also make requests for remote content at any time, in order to interact with a web service or pull new content from the web.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-determine-which-version-of-chrome-is-deployed-to-which-channel" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/faq/#faq-dev-14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#</a> How do I determine which version of Chrome is deployed to which channel? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-determine-which-version-of-chrome-is-deployed-to-which-channel" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>To determine which version of Chrome is currently available on each of the different platforms, visit <a href="https://omahaproxy.appspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">omahaproxy.appspot.com</a>.

For extensions that need to execute SQL queries on their stored data, Chrome implements <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">client side SQL databases</a>, which may be used as well.</p><h3 id="can-extensions-use-oauth" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/faq/#faq-dev-04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#</a> Can extensions use OAuth? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-extensions-use-oauth" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Yes, there are extensions that use OAuth to access remote data APIs. Most developers find it convenient to use a <a href="https://unitedheroes.net/OAuthSimple/js/OAuthSimple.js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript OAuth library</a> in order to simplify the process of signing OAuth requests.</p><h3 id="can-extensions-create-ui-outside-of-the-rendered-web-page" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/faq/#faq-dev-05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#</a> Can extensions create UI outside of the rendered web page? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-extensions-create-ui-outside-of-the-rendered-web-page" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Yes, your extension may add buttons to the Chrome browser&#39;s user interface. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/browserAction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">browser actions</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/pageAction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">page actions</a> for more information.</p><p>An extension may also create popup notifications, which exist outside of the browser window.

However, you must modify the tracking code to pull an HTTPS version of the Google Analytics library.

Allowing content scripts on <code>chrome://</code> URLs would mean that developers would begin to rely on the DOM, CSS, and JavaScript of these pages to stay the same. In the best case, these pages could not be updated as quickly as they are being updated right now. In the worst case, it could mean that an update to one of these pages could cause an extension to break, causing key parts of the browser to stop working for users of that extension.</p><p>The reason that <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/override/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">replacing the content</a> hosted at these URLs entirely is allowed is because it forces an extension developer to implement all of the functionality they want without depending on the browser&#39;s internal implementation to stay the same.</p><h3 id="can-extensions-open-browser-page-action-popups-without-user-interaction" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/faq/#faq-open-popups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#</a> Can extensions open browser/page action popups without user interaction? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-extensions-open-browser-page-action-popups-without-user-interaction" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>No, popups can only be opened if the user clicks on the corresponding page or browser action.

Additionally, many sites do not own all of the TLDs for their domain. For an example, assume you want to use <code>https://example.*/*</code> to match <code>https://example.com</code> and <code>https://example.es</code>, but <code>https://example.net</code> is a hostile site. If your extension has a bug, the hostile site could potentially attack your extension in order to get access to your extension&#39;s increased privileges.</p><p>You should explicitly enumerate the TLDs that you wish to run your extension on.</p><h3 id="why-does-the-management-api-not-fire-events-when-my-extension-is-installed-uninstalled" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/faq/#faq-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">#</a> Why does the management API not fire events when my extension is installed/uninstalled? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-the-management-api-not-fire-events-when-my-extension-is-installed-uninstalled" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">management API</a> was intended to help create new tab page replacement extensions.

The best thing to do is to make sure an appropriate issue report is filed, and the Chromium team has enough information to reproduce the behavior.</p><p>The steps you should follow to ensure this are:</p><ol><li>Come up with a <em>minimal</em> test extension that demonstrates the issue you wish to report. This extension should have as little code as possible to demonstrate the bug\u2014generally this should be 100 lines of code or less. Many times, developers find that they cannot reproduce their issues this way, which is a good indicator that the bug is in their own code.</li><li>Search the issue tracker at <a href="https://crbug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://crbug.com</a> to see whether someone has reported a similar issue. Most issues related to extensions are filed under <strong>component=Platform&gt;Extensions</strong>, so to look for an extension bug related to the chrome.scripting.executeScript function (for example), search for &quot;<code>component=Platform&gt;Extensions Type=Bug chrome.scripting.executeScript</code>&quot;, which will give you <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=component%3DPlatform%3EExtensions+Type%3DBug+chrome.scripting.executeScript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this list of results</a>.</li><li>If you find a bug that describes your issue, click the star icon to be notified when the bug receives an update. <em>Do not respond to the bug to say &quot;me too&quot; or ask &quot;when will this be fixed?&quot;</em>; such updates can cause hundreds of emails to be sent. Add a comment only if you have information (such as a better test case or a suggested fix) that is likely to be helpful.</li><li>If you found no appropriate bug to star, file a new issue report at <a href="https://crbug.com/new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://crbug.com/new</a>. Be as explicit as possible when filling out this form: choose a descriptive title, explain the steps to reproduce the bug, and describe the expected and actual behavior. Attach your test example to the report and add screenshots if appropriate. The easier your report makes it for others to reproduce your issue, the greater chance that your bug will be fixed promptly.</li><li>Wait for the bug to be updated. Most new bugs are triaged within a week, although it can sometimes take longer for an update. <em>Do not reply to the bug to ask when the issue will be fixed.</em> If your bug has not been modified after two weeks, please post a message to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions/topics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">discussion group</a> with a link back to your bug.</li><li>If you originally reported your bug on the discussion group and were directed to this FAQ entry, reply to your original thread with a link to the bug you starred or reported.
